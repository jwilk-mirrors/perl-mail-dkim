Policy lookup

Example A
---------

From:   Jason <jason@bigbank.com>
Sender: Bad guy <badguy@example.org>

In this case, bigbank.com wants to provide a way for recipients
to recognize forgories or altered messages coming from their domain.

They publish a draft-allman-dkim-ssp policy record in their DNS

  bigbank.com.      DKIMP  "p=strict"

With such a policy, bigbank.com's users cannot send mail through
mungling mailing lists, or through their other ISPs mail servers.
In the first case, the signature would become invalid. In the second
case, the message won't have a signature. In both cases, the policy
for bigbank.com says to reject the message.


Example B
---------

From:   Jason <jlong@messiah.edu>
Sender: My list <discuss@list.example.com>

In this example, messiah.edu allows their users to send messages through
mailing lists, so it has no need for a p=strict policy like example A.
However, this means messages can be trivially forged.

But maybe they could use a rfc4870(historical) policy to indicate that
whenever the "sender" of the message is a messiah.edu address, the
message will contain a messiah.edu signature. So...

  _domainkey.messiah.edu.  TXT  "o=-"

When this message comes through, it is allowed despite not having a valid
messiah.edu signature because the message itself doesn't claim to have
come from messiah.edu (although some recipients may not know this because
their MUA doesn't show it).

But if the only originator address found in the message was
jlong@messiah.edu, the above policy would require a valid messiah.edu
signature.


Example C
---------

From:   George <george@example.com>
Sender: Discuss <discuss@listserv.messiah.edu>

This time I'm interested in the perspective of the Listserv operator.
The Listserv operator wants to ensure that messages going out to the
list have a listserv.messiah.edu signature, and wants to communicate
to recipients that unsigned messages claiming to be from the list are
forgories.

Once again, a rfc4870(historical) policy seems the most useful:

  _domainkey.listserv.messiah.edu.   TXT   "o=-"
