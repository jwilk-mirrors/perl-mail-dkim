Following are some notes about gray areas in the RFC 4871 DKIM
specification.


Section 3.4.4 "relaxed" Body Canonicalization

  Empty bodies. Unlike the "simple" body canonicalization, which
  explicitly says to add a CRLF, the "relaxed" body canonicalization
  does not say this. The consensus at DKIM-Interop was NOT to add
  a CRLF for "relaxed" body canonicalization when the body is empty.


Section 3.6.1 "granularity of the key"

  Does "an empty g= value never matches any addresses" mean that any
  signature, no matter the i= value, using this key cannot be
  matched? The consensus at DKIM-Interop was that YES, that's what
  it means.

  It should be noted that this is an incompatible change from
  RFC4870-DomainKeys, where an empty g= tag in the public key is
  equivalent to g=*, which would match anything.
