Mail-DKIM version 0.39
======================

This module implements the various components of the DKIM and DomainKeys
message-signing and verifying standards for Internet mail. It currently
tries to implement these specifications:
 * RFC4871, for DKIM
 * RFC4870, for DomainKeys

With each release, this module is getting bigger, but don't worry,
most of the growth is from having more things to test with `make test'.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA
  Digest::SHA
  Mail::Address (part of the MailTools package)
  MIME::Base64
  Net::DNS

USAGE

Decide whether you want to "sign" or "verify" messages.
To sign, see the Mail::DKIM::Signer module.
To verify, see the Mail::DKIM::Verifier module.

BUGS

Some details of the specification are not completely implemented.
See the TODO file for a list of things I know about.

Report bugs to Jason Long <jason@long.name>.
If `make test' fails, please include the versions of your
installed Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA module and OpenSSL libraries.
