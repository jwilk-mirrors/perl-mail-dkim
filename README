Mail-DKIM version 0.17
======================

This module implements the various components of the DKIM message-signing
and verifying standard for Internet mail. It currently implements
Internet Draft draft-allman-dkim-base-01.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum
  Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA
  Crypt::RSA
  Digest::SHA
  Digest::SHA1
  Mail::Address (part of the MailTools package)
  MIME::Base64
  Net::DNS

The Crypt::RSA dependency is especially messy, since it in turn depends
on many other libraries. I've had a particular problem installing the
Crypt::Random package through CPAN, which seems to stall in the test phase.
It may help to `force install Crypt::Random' and press Ctrl+C if it gets
stuck on the test phase.

BUGS

The current draft as of this writing, draft-ietf-dkim-base-01.txt of
April 2006, is not yet supported.
