 * t/signer_dk.t: create regression tests for DomainKeys signature
   generation

2010-06-11: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier.pm, Signer.pm, Algorithm/Base.pm
   (finish_header): provide reference to entire list of headers at
   completion of header, so that canonicalizers do not need to store
   their own copy of the header
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Canonicalization/DkimCommon.pm: do not store header as
   parsed, rather only canonicalize header within finish_header()
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Canonicalization/DkCommon.pm: do not store header as
   parsed, rather only canonicalize header within finish_header()

   Canonicalization/Base.pm

2010-06-03: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier.pm: prevent abuse- if a message has more than
   50 signatures headers, we start ignoring them (it's unreasonable for
   a message to have more than a very few signature headers).

2010-04-08: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * t/verifier.t: wrote some tests for DomainKey signatures with empty,
   missing, or invalid q= tag values
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier.pm: move use of check_signature_identity() out
   of finish_header() and into check_and_verify_signature(); this fixes
   an issue with getting wrong error codes when q= tag is broken.

   whether a linebreak is acceptable; other fixes
 * t/textwrap.t: another test case illustrating failure in TextWrap.pm
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/KeyValueList.pm (wrap): call flush() right after the

 * lib/Mail/DKIM/DkimPolicy.pm: fix "use of uninitialized value in string"
   errors
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Signature.pm: provide public API to public-key object of
   signatures, e.g. so its flags can be accessed (issue #1879215);
   also, if an error occurs fetching the public-key record, the failure
   is cached so it won't get tried again
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Signer.pm: document how to create a DomainKey-Signature

2008-02-20: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>

2008-01-10: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * Makefile.PL: bump version
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Signature.pm: make sure all public key problems are
   prefixed with "public key:" (most were already, see below for actual
   changes)
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/PublicKey.pm: since Signature.pm is providing the "public
   key:" prefix, it can be omitted in PublicKey.pm error messages
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier: the following result_detail messages have changed:
     "no public key available" => "public key: not available"
     "key value list syntax error" => "syntax error"
                                   or "public key: syntax error"

 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Algorithm/*: implement wants_pre_signature_headers()
   for each algorithm
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier.pm: if the algorithm "wants_pre_signature_headers",
   then feed headers found prior to the signature to the
   signature-specific algorithm doing the verification. This fixes an
   issue where signatures from cisco.com fail to verify (reported by
   Mark Martinec).

 -- VERSION 0.30 --

2007-12-10: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier.pm (is_subdomain): do case-insensitive
   comparison
 * t/corpus/good_dk_7.txt: tests DK signature with domain names that
   differ only in case
 * t/corpus/good_rfc4871_4.txt: tests DKIM signature with i= and d=
   contain domain names differing in case
 * t/corpus/badkey_12.txt: tests public key where i=JLong, g=jl*ng

2007-12-07: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * t/verifier.t: three new DK tests
 * t/corpus/good_dk_6.txt: tests DK signature without h= tag
 * t/corpus/bad_dk_2.txt: tests DK signature w/o h= tag, Sender has
   been added
 * t/corpus/dk_multiple_1.txt: tests two DK signatures (with different
   domains) in a single message... both should pass
 * Makefile.PL: version bump

2007-12-07: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier.pm, lib/Mail/DKIM/Algorithm/dk_rsa_sha1.pm,
   lib/Mail/DKIM/Canonicalization/DkCommon.pm:
   domainkeys: determine identity from algorithm object.  Currently the
   DomainKeys identity is determined by the Verifier.  It is
   theoretically possible for two different DomainKeys signatures on
   the same message to have different identities.  (This happens when
   one DomainKey signature includes a Sender header, and the other one
   does not.) This patch moves the determination of identity to the
   algorithm object.

2007-12-07: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier.pm, lib/Mail/DKIM/Common.pm: initialize
   signatures early.  This patch makes Mail::DKIM::Verifier initialize
   and check the signature object as soon as it is parsed, and
   subsequent headers are fed into the algorithm as they are read,
   instead of waiting for the end of header.
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier.pm: fix DK identity.  The previous patch broke
   identity-checking for DomainKeys signatures.  This patch moves some
   things around so that identity checking still works.

2007-12-07: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier.pm (add_signature): changed to take a
   signature object, instead of an unparsed header line

2007-11-21: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * t/corpus/bad_dk_2.txt renamed to dk_headers_2.txt: revert this
   rename from earlier... the message should "pass" after
   all (the Sender header was not part of the signature)

2007-11-21: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Signer.pm: provide documentation for Key parameter
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/PrivateKey.pm: created documentation for this package
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Signature.pm: implement Key parameter for constructor,
   and key() method to get/set the private key

2007-11-14: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier.pm: for DomainKeys signatures, use the message
   sender as the identity
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/DkSignature.pm: allow verifier to supply the signing
   identity
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier.pm, PublicKey.pm: hack for allowing
   DomainKeys signatures to use public keys with empty g= tags

2007-11-14: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier.pm, Signer.pm: update documentation for
   message_sender() and message_originator() methods, which are now
   guaranteed to return an object
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Common.pm (message_sender, message_originator):
   always return a Mail::Address object, even if the relevant headers
   were not found
 * t/corpus/dk_headers_2.txt renamed to bad_dk_2.txt: it turns out this
   message should've been failing all along, since the Sender header
   doesn't match the domain of the signature
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier.pm: slight change to the "unsupported version"
   detail message (don't want nested parenthesis)

2007-11-14: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * t/corpus/goodkey_4.txt: tests signature with i=a@b, public key implied g=
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/PublicKey.pm (check_granularity): fixed broken
   ends-with check, reported by Mark Martinec
 * t/corpus/good_dk_3.txt, good_dk_4.txt, good_dk_5.txt:
   these files test DomainKeys signatures with g= values in the public keys
 * t/corpus/bad_dk_1.txt: this one should fail, since the signature
   domain does not match the From/Sender header
 * scripts/dkimsign.pl: added option to override signature's d= tag
 * t/corpus/badkey_11.txt: tests a valid, but unmatched h= in public key
