 * t/verifier: added two new DomainKeys messages to test
   - t/corpus/good_dk_yahoo.txt
   - t/corpus/good_dk_gmail.txt
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Canonicalization/dk_nofws.pm: added support for the
   DomainKeys "nofws" canonicalization method
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier.pm: recognize DomainKeys signatures;
   signatures now determine which algorithm class to use
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Algorithm/Base.pm: refactored a few things to better
   accomodate non-DKIM algorithms
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Algorithm/dk_rsa_sha1.pm: implements the DomainKeys
   rsa-sha1 algorithm
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/DkSignature.pm: handles DomainKeys signatures
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Signer.pm: signature now determines which algorithm class
   to use
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/PublicKey.pm: change an error message from "headers have
   been alterered" to "message has been altered" (if the headers have been
   altered, we really cannot imply that the body is still intact)
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Common.pm: removed get_algorithm_class (this is now a
   signature method)
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Signature.pm: added get_algorithm_class; documented
   get_public_key method

2006-09-28: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * README: include "Error" in the list of dependencies
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Common.pm (get_algorithm_class): return undef instead of
   throwing an error when an unsupported algorithm is presented
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Signature.pm (parse): allow v=0.5 tag
   (check_protocol): checks for dns option /txt (i.e. "dns/txt")
   (version): new method for getting/setting v= tag
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier.pm (check_signature): fixed algorithm check
 * t/verifier: added several additional sample emails to verify, including
   a ietf05 signature, and six cases where the signature should be ignored
   for one reason or another

 -- VERSION 0.19 --

2006-06-15: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * Makefile.PL: change Perl version check to v5.6.1 instead of 5.8
 * t/verifier.t: use binmode function instead of ":raw" layer, for
   Perl 5.6.1 compatibility

 -- VERSION 0.18 --

2006-06-09: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * t/verifier.t: open message in ":raw" mode to avoid CRLF->LF
   conversion (reported by Eugene Pivovarav)

2006-06-08: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/PublicKey.pm: rewrote verify_digest() so that it uses
   the Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA module exclusively, no longer relying on
   Crypt::RSA::Primitives
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/PrivateKey.pm: rewrote sign_digest() so it uses
   Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA exclusively
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Key.pm: calculate_EM() - remove dependency on
   Crypt::RSA::DataFormat
 * Makefile.PL, README: remove mentions of Crypt::RSA and
   Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum

 -- VERSION 0.17 --

2006-05-26: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Algorithm/Base.pm: check_body_hash() - new method
   that verifies the body hash against the bh= tag; format for
   canonicalization debugging output has changed
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Algorithm/rsa_sha1.pm: call check_body_hash() before
   returning results to verify()
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Algorithm/rsa_sha256.pm: call check_body_hash() before
   returning results to verify()
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Canonicalization/DkimCommon.pm: fixed bug where extra
   CRLF was being canonicalized
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Key.pm: moved calculate_EM function here from PrivateKey
   after realizing that it would be needed when verifying
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/PublicKey.pm: now SHA256 hashes can be verified as well;
   also, the verification can distinguish between wrong hash and a
   bad signature
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier.pm: provide result details when verification
   fails; added documentation for the result_detail() method
 * t/corpus/: added several sample signed messages for the testing routines

2006-04-17: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Algorithm/Base.pm: common class for DKIM algorithms
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Algorithm/rsa_sha1.pm: now subclasses Algorithm::Base.
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Algorithm/rsa_sha256.pm: new class for handling the
   rsa-sha256 DKIM algorithm
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Common.pm: recognize rsa-sha256 algorithm
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/PrivateKey.pm: implemented signing of a SHA-256 digest
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/PublicKey.pm: implemented verifying of a SHA-256 digest
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Signature.pm: allows algorithm to be "rsa-sha256";
   body_hash() - new method handling the bh tag;
   hash_algorithm() - new method to determine what hash is being used;
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Verifier.pm: check_public_key() - new method for checking
   the validity of a fetched public key
 * Makefile.PL: added Digest::SHA as a dependency

2006-03-26: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Common.pm: remove version number from this file
 * lib/Mail/DKIM.pm: bump version to 0.17
 * README: bump version to 0.17

 -- VERSION 0.16 --

2006-03-03: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Policy.pm: new() and testing() are now warning-free
   (thanks to jm@jmason.org for the patch)
 * t/policy.t: tests the Policy package

2006-03-01: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Signature.pm: correctly handle spaces around = character
 * t/signature.t: test for spaces around = character in signature

2006-02-24: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * t/: wrote some tests and added them to the project
 * README, Makefile.PL: discovered additional dependency:
   Crypt::OpenSSL::Bignum
 * lib/Mail/DKIM/Signature.pm: fixed a warning that could occur if
   the h= tag was left undefined

2006-02-23: Jason Long <jlong@messiah.edu>
 * converted to ExtUtils::MakeMaker package format,
   see the dkimproxy project for revision history prior to 2006-02-23.
