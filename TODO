DKIM-Signature:
 - allow version tag (DONE)
 - accept q=dns/txt (DONE)

DKIM Public Key Records:
 - enforce t=s option (if present)

Verifier:
 - verify multiple signatures (ietf05 6.1) (DONE)
 - check that From header is signed (ietf05 6.1.1)
 - check public key "granularity"
 - handle no response from first DNS server listed in resolv.conf
   (currently it goes to the second server after 5 seconds,
   but it does this for EVERY signature, so this will badly affect
   overall throughput)
 - **minor bug**- when Debug_Canonicalization=1 on a message with
   multiple signatures, the canonicalized output is recorded multiple times.
   Probably only the first valid signature should receive the
   Debug_Canonicalization option

Signer:
 - allow DomainKeys signatures without using a policy object
 - allow adding chained signatures in one pass
   (e.g. allow adding a DomainKeys signature, and a DKIM signature,
   with the new DKIM signature signing the new DomainKeys signature)
 - allow creation of i=, l=, t=, x=, and z= tags
 - do header-wrapping to signature before signing

Testing (some of this may already be implemented):
 - test public key errors:
   - DNS timeout
   - SERVFAIL
   - syntax error in public key record
 - test DNS timeout for signing policy
 - test signature options:
   - unspecified query type
   - query type of "dns/"
   - bad query type
   - bad algorithm
   - unspecified algorithm
   - bad canonicalization
   - unspecified canonicalization
   - test presence of version tag in signature
 - IMPORTANT- allow `make test' to work when DNS is not available

Possible issues in base-10 draft:
 - 6.1.2 - check g= tag of public key against i= tag of signature
 - 6.1.2 - check h= tag of public key against a= tag of signature
 - 3.5 - t= tag, create it when signing messages, check it when verifying
 - 3.5 - x= tag, create it when signing messages, check it when verifying
 - 5.4 - allow better control of which headers to sign
 - 5.5 - recommended headers to sign and NOT to sign
 - 3.3.1 - what's an RSA exponent?
 - 6.1.1 - configurable list of unacceptable signing domains,
       e.g. "com" and "co.uk"
